			<string>Oh look, it&apos;s a new face. I haven&apos;t seen you down here before. My name is &lt;b&gt;Whalezart&lt;/b&gt; and this is where I live. It&apos;s called the &lt;b&gt;Tiny Barrier Reef.&lt;/b&gt; </string>
			<string>Do you see those pretty rocks? Those are called &lt;b&gt;coral.&lt;/b&gt; It&apos;s a very colorful place, but sometimes it gets too quiet. </string>
			<string>Wait, you&apos;re not from the sea, are you? Oh! I can see your fingers! I only have &lt;b&gt;flippers&lt;/b&gt;. That means you can help us make some music. </string>

			<string>The sea is always singing, we just have to be clever enough to hear it. I think it’s all in the &lt;b&gt;bubbles.&lt;/b&gt;</string>
			<string>If you see any &lt;b&gt;bubbles&lt;/b&gt; floating up, make sure you pop them. But you have to pop them in the right order, otherwise it won’t sound very good.</string>

		<array>
			<string>My friends, &lt;b&gt;The Clams&lt;/b&gt;, heard you were visiting, and they wanted to come out and play too!</string>
			<string>They’re really good at making music, but they don’t know how to work together. It’s up to you to help.</string>
			<string>What ever color bubble you see, you have to touch the clam that has that color, so if you see a red bubble, touch the red clam! But you can’t be too slow, otherwise the bubbles will float away.</string>
