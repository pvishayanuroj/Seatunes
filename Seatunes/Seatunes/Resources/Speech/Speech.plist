			<string>Hey there, little buddy! My name is Paul the Whale, I&apos;ll be your teacher while you&apos;re visiting us under the ocean.</string>
			<string>If you look down there, you&apos;ll see my friends, the Crazy Clams, they make music when you touch them. Why don&apos;t you give it a try? Just tap any of them with your finger. Go ahead!</string>

			<string>Now that you got the hang of it, we&apos;re going to play a little game to make some more music. </string>
			<string>I&apos;m going to blow a bubble, and you&apos;ll see one of my clam friends open his mouth to sing.</string>
			<string>After we&apos;re done, then it&apos;s your turn to play the same note! OK, are you ready yet?  You can tell me you&apos;re ready by poking me, but not too hard!</string>

			<string>Hello, I&apos;m Paul the Whale. You have to help me! I don&apos;t know where my voice went. No, not this voice, my SINGING voice.</string>
			<string>I got up today, and I can&apos;t sing anymore. I called my friends, the Clams, over to help, but they don&apos;t know my songs. Maybe you can help. I don&apos;t know if you&apos;re ready for this yet...</string>
			<string>Well, maybe you are, little buddy. But you can&apos;t let me down! I&apos;m going to blow all the notes out, and you have to follow along. If I blow a red bubble, you have to play the red clam.</string>
			<string>Don&apos;t fall behind. If you can&apos;t let any of my bubbles float away, we have to start over again, otherwise everybody will think I&apos;m a bad singer.</string>
