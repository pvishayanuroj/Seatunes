			<string>Oh look, it&apos;s a new face. I haven&apos;t seen you down here before. My name is &lt;b&gt;Whalezart&lt;/b&gt; and this is where I live. It&apos;s called the &lt;b&gt;Tiny Barrier Reef.&lt;/b&gt; </string>
			<string>Do you see those pretty rocks? Those are called &lt;b&gt;coral.&lt;/b&gt; It&apos;s a very colorful place, but sometimes it gets too quiet. </string>
			<string>Wait, you&apos;re not from the sea, are you? Oh! I can see your fingers! I only have &lt;b&gt;flippers&lt;/b&gt;. That means you can help us make some music. </string>
		</array>
	</array>
	<key>Easy Tutorial</key>
	<array>
		<array>
			<string>The sea is always singing, we just have to be clever enough to hear it. I think it’s all in the &lt;b&gt;bubbles.&lt;/b&gt;</string>
			<string>If you see any &lt;b&gt;bubbles&lt;/b&gt; floating up, make sure you pop them. But you have to pop them in the right order, otherwise it won’t sound very good.</string>
		</array>
	</array>
	<key>Medium Tutorial</key>
	<array>
		<array>
			<string>My friends, &lt;b&gt;The Clams&lt;/b&gt;, heard you were visiting, and they wanted to come out and play too!</string>
			<string>They’re really good at making music, but they don’t know how to work together. It’s up to you to help.</string>
			<string>What ever color bubble you see, you have to touch the clam that has that color, so if you see a red bubble, touch the red clam! But you can’t be too slow, otherwise the bubbles will float away.</string>

			<string>Ok, here goes nothing. Get ready!</string>

	<key>Scoldings</key>
	<array>
		<array>
			<string>Oh no, that&apos;s not right. Try again.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>No, I don&apos;t think that&apos;s correct.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>That sounds weird. Why don&apos;t you try again?</string>
		</array>
	</array>
	<key>Song Complete Good</key>
	<array>
		<array>
			<string>That sounded great, I knew you could do it!</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>That was music to my ears! Good job!</string>
		</array>
	</array>
	<key>Song Complete Bad</key>
	<array>
		<array>
			<string>Hmm… I think you need more practice. Remember, practice makes perfect.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>You’ll do better next time, I know it. Just remember to practice.</string>
		</array>
	</array>
	<key>Score Explanation</key>
	<array>
		<array>
			<string>This is the score screen. It tells you how well you did. You can even see how many notes you missed. If you played well enough, you’ll earn a &lt;b&gt;badge&lt;/b&gt; for each difficulty.</string>
		</array>
	</array>
	<key>Random Saying</key>
	<array>
		<array>
			<string>There&apos;s always music around us, you just have to know where to find it.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>Have you been to the &lt;b&gt;Great Barrier Reef?&lt;/b&gt; I heard it’s almost as nice as this.</string>
		</array>
		<array>
			<string>Did you know some whales, such as &lt;b&gt;humpback whales,&lt;/b&gt; can sing too?</string>
		</array>
	</array>
	<key>Tutorial Prompt</key>
	<array>
		<array>
			<string>Oh, I see you this is your first time playing this mode. Do you want to have a lesson first? I can teach you how to read &lt;b&gt;musical notation.&lt;/b&gt;</string>
